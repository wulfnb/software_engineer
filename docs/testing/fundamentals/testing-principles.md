# Testing Principles

## FIRST Principles
- **F**ast - Tests should run quickly
- **I**solated - Tests shouldn't depend on each other
- **R**epeatable - Tests should give same results every time
- **S**elf-validating - Tests should clearly pass or fail
- **T**imely - Tests should be written at the right time

## Right-BICEP
- **R**ight - Are results right?
- **B**oundary conditions - Check edge cases
- **I**nverse relationships - Check inverse operations
- **C**ross-check - Use different methods
- **E**rror conditions - Force error conditions
- **P**erformance - Check performance characteristics
